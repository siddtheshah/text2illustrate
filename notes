Things to do:
- Improve the processText_v2 script
    > Want to handle adjectives of the form "A was/is B", where B is an adjective
    > Is necessary for descriptive sentences. "A was above B"
    > Need to set up named entity data. Use Stanford NLP person/place/gender/animacy
- Set up script reduce
    > Figure out how to conjoin the script.
    > Script continuum done. <Kindof>
- Set up setting info
